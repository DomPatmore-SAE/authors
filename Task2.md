**Note: Please ensure you have completed Task 1**

This morning we looked at a prominent hero in computing, Alan Turing

1. Create an array with the following names:
    Alan Turing
    Langston Hughes
    James Baldwin
    Oscar Wilde

2. Write code to show:
   1. The number of people in the list
   2. _for each_ item in the list, display the name (Use all 3 methods of iterating through arrays)
   3. Sort the list alphabetically 
   4. Insert another LGBTQ historical figure at the beginning of the list

3. Now, we'll need to show our information on our page. Create an element on your page that you can target. Once you can confirm that element has been loaded, create an 'Alan Turing' object. This object has:
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Date of Birth
    - Best Known For
    Complete these fields, then show the content on the page. You should strive to make it look presentable.
