1. Now, we'll need to show our information on our page. Create an element on your page that you can target. Once you can confirm that element has been loaded, create an 'Alan Turing' object. This object has:
    - First Name (String)
    - Last Name (String)
    - Born(String)
    - Best Known For (List of things)
    - Full Name (Function the returns the first and last name)
    Complete these fields, then show the content on the page. You should strive to make it look presentable.

2. Return to the list you created in Step one, but instead of names, create the same object for those people within. Loop through the list, and display the elements in the following order:
   - Full Name
   - Date of Birth
   - Achievements
